# Warehouse Space Utilization Framework & Excel Calculator

A practical, engineering-first approach to understanding and calculating warehouse space utilization using first principles and spreadsheet modeling.

This project breaks warehouse utilization down to its fundamentals — **the box (warehouse), the grid (racking), and the object (pallet)** — and provides a reusable Excel-based calculator for capacity and utilization analysis.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Many warehouses feel “full” while still wasting significant space.  
This project was built to answer two critical questions clearly and separately:

- **Are we running out of pallet slots right now?**
- **Are we efficiently using the physical volume of the building?**

By separating **Pallet Position Utilization** from **Cubic Utilization**, this framework helps warehouse and supply chain professionals make better operational and strategic decisions.

## 👥 Who This Is For

This project is designed for:

- Warehouse Managers  
- Supply Chain Analysts  
- Logistics & Industrial Engineers  
- WMS Implementers  
- Facility & Capacity Planners  
- Operations Consultants  

No advanced software is required — only Excel and basic operational data.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

- Warehouse dimensions as a 3-D physical system  
- Gross vs usable warehouse volume  
- Inventory cube calculation  
- Cubic utilization vs pallet position utilization  
- Why warehouses can be “full” and “empty” at the same time  
- Practical capacity planning logic used in real operations  

---

## 📊 Excel Template (Main Deliverable)

The Excel model included in this repository calculates:

- Total warehouse cubic capacity  
- Usable warehouse volume (after operational constraints)  
- Inventory cube consumption  
- Cubic utilization percentage  
- Pallet position utilization percentage  
- SKU-level space usage  

### Key Features
- Formula-driven (no macros)  
- Structured inputs and calculated outputs  
- Ready for real warehouse data  
- Suitable for analysis, reporting, and planning discussions

## 🚀 How to Use This Project

1. Review the documentation in the `/docs` folder to understand the logic  
2. Open the Excel template and enter:
   - Warehouse dimensions  
   - Pallet dimensions  
   - Inventory counts  
   - Rack configuration  
3. Use the calculated KPIs to:
   - Identify space bottlenecks  
   - Support layout redesign decisions  
   - Communicate capacity insights to stakeholders

## 📌 Why This Project Matters

Warehouse utilization is often misunderstood because volume and slot availability are mixed together.

This framework helps teams:
- Stop guessing about capacity  
- Avoid premature warehouse expansion  
- Improve storage efficiency using data, not intuition
