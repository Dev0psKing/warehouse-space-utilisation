# The Physics: What Warehouse Dimensions Really Mean

Before we look at inventory, we must define the container. Imagine the warehouse is completely empty—no racks, no forklifts, no people.

## The Geometry
The warehouse forms a massive rectangular box defined by three dimensions:
1.  **Length:** Front to back
2.  **Width:** Left to right
3.  **Height:** Floor to the highest safe storage level

### Gross Warehouse Volume
In engineering terms, this is the total volume of air within the walls.

**Example Calculation:**
*   Length: 60 meters
*   Width: 40 meters
*   Height: 10 meters

$$ Volume = 60m \times 40m \times 10m = 24,000 m^3 $$

## The Reality Check: Why Gross Volume is a Lie
If you build a business plan assuming you can store $24,000 m^3$ of product, you will fail. A warehouse is an operational environment, not a solid block.

You lose Gross Volume to:
*   **Aisles:** Forklift travel paths (often 50%+ of floor space).
*   **Structure:** Columns and beams.
*   **Staging:** Inbound/Outbound docks.
*   **Fire & Safety:** Clearance zones for sprinklers.

### Usable Space Factor
To get a realistic number, we apply a **Usable Space Factor** (efficiency percentage).

*   **0.55 – 0.60:** Poor layout / Wide aisles
*   **0.65 – 0.75:** Average warehouse
*   **0.80+:** Highly Optimised / VNA (Very Narrow Aisle)

**The Adjusted Calculation (Using 0.75 factor):**
$$ Usable Volume = 24,000 m^3 \times 0.75 = 18,000 m^3 $$

> **Key Takeaway:** This $18,000 m^3$ is your actual canvas. This is the denominator for all cubic calculations.

*Now that we know the size of the box, let's measure the volume inside.*
