# Warehouse Utilisation: The Definitive Guide

**A warehouse is, fundamentally, just a 3-D box. Utilisation is simply the measure of how much of that box you are actually using.**

While logistics can feel complicated—filled with WMS data, erratic SKUs, and complex spreadsheets—everything eventually boils down to physics. If you understand the geometry of the box, the metrics will take care of themselves.

In this documentation, we strip away the complexity and rebuild the concept of warehouse utilisation from the ground up, moving from the physical walls to the logic of your dashboard.
