# Metric #2: Pallet Position Utilisation (The "Slot" Check)

Cubic utilisation is about volume; Pallet Position Utilisation is about **Slots**. This is the metric Operations Managers check daily to answer: *"Can we receive the inbound truck?"*

## 1. Defining Capacity
A pallet position is a single physical location (a slot) capable of holding one pallet.

**Example Rack Configuration:**
*   100 Bays
*   5 Levels High
*   1 Pallet Deep

$$ Total Positions = 100 \times 5 \times 1 = 500 Positions $$

## 2. The Calculation
If you currently have **425 pallets** in stock:

$$ Pallet Utilisation = \frac{425}{500} = 85\% $$

## 3. The Operational Reality
*   **< 75%:** Safe zone. Plenty of room for put-away.
*   **85% - 90%:** Congestion zone. Put-away takes longer as drivers hunt for empty slots.
*   **> 90%:** Gridlock. You may need to stage product on the floor.

> **Ops Note:** You can have 85% Pallet Utilisation (Operational Fullness) but only 10% Cubic Utilisation (Strategic Emptiness). This discrepancy is explained in the Case Study.
